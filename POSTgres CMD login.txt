For each server on pgAdmin, there's an expandable Databases, Login/Group Roles, and Tablespaces

Under Login/Group, create another role if there is only the default. [There's a password assigned here? Missing a step somewhere] Assign it appropriate privileges.

Worked at home: 
psql -U [username] -d [database]

Use that to login, asks for pw. Then db prompt (ends in #). use -c type command in here; to make queries. (semicolon very important)

Run from file? \i your_file_name_here (in cwd or with path?)
