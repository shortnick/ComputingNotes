looking at some standard work-flows
git is an 'active' workflow- it helps when you're intentional and conscious about it.

not good for binary files (i.e. proprietary standards like Adobe), but tracks line changes (good for things like geoJSON)

cmd to add a new file to current dir: echo.>NEWFILE.txt 

cmd copy a file: copy filepath\filename.txt filepath\newfile.txt

whole directory copy
copy filepath\folder\*.* filepath\newfolder

have to set git credentials and set your "upstream" master (if you make the directory locally, before the cloud or github version knows about it)

to fork a github project, hit the button on the website, and in your directory on cmd: git clone filepath\filename.git
